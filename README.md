Html page generator from given values in Python.


# Use 
Run the "EasyHtmlCreator.html" file in any code editor.

The code asks the user for specific data, which will then be generated as html
and he do it in a simple way.
It also allows color manipulation.


# Objective
The idea for the project was the question I asked myself "Can artificial intelligence program?",
so I decided to realize it.

The final effect is not complicated, his task was to realize the idea,
but it can be used, for example in writing an essay or short content

I don't plan to develop it in the future because html have easy navigation directly in himself.
